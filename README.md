# 30 Days of Data Structures

With this challenge I aim to understand and implement some basic data structures which are the foundation of efficient codes.

Do not expect the implementations to be the best or to be bug free. 

Each data structure has its own directory along with a separate README file.

## Contents
- Array
	- Access
	- Search
	- Insertion (at end)
	- Deletion (at specified index)

## Progress

**Day 00** - Data Structures basics
**Day 01** - Array and its basic operations
