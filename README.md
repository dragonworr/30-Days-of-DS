# 30 Days of Data Structures

With this challenge I aim to understand and implement some basic data structures which are the foundation of efficient codes.

Do not expect the implementations to be the best or to be bug free. 

Each data structure has its own directory along with a separate README file.

## Contents
- Array
	- Access
	- Search
	- Insertion (at end)
	- Deletion (at specified index)

## Progress

**Day 01** - Data Structures basics

#### What is a Data Structure?
The amount of resources (time and space) that a computer has is limited. We can always add more resources to a computer but we also want to maximize our profit. So to get maximum performance out of these limited resources we use different techniques a.k.a **data structures** that organize data in such a way that it can be used effectively.

#### Some basic Data Structures
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
	- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Hashing
- Graph

**Day 01**  - Array and its basic operations
