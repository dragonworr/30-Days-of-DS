## What is a Data Structure?
The amount of resources (time and space) that a computer has is limited. We can always add more resources to a computer but we also want to maximize our profit. So to get maximum performance out of these limited resources we use different techniques a.k.a **data structures** that organize data in such a way that it can be used effectively.
